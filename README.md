# Sorting Visualizer 
An animated visualization of sorting algorithms which showcasing the inner workings of the sorting algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms   
  1. Bubble sort           
  2. Selection sort
  3. Insertion sort
  4. Merge sort
  5. Quick sort
  6. Heap sort 
## About this Project
This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JS. This project sorting visualizer is a very simple UI and it allows the users to select the sort algorithm, select the array size, and speed of the visualization.

## What's inside this Project
Currently available sorting algorithms- Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quicksort and Heap sort (I will plan to bring more algorithms in action to visualize & more changes).
You can change the size of the array
You can change the speed of the visualization

Here in our model, each element value is represented by the size of the bar and the algorithms sort them by placing the smallest elements on the left and the biggest elements on the right
The algorithms moves the items around by swapping elements, Without using any addational memory with creating another array.
